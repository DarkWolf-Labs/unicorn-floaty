# Unicorn Floaty

## Description

This project is meant to showcase how to deploy selected applications into AWS or GCP

## Layout

The top level folders indicate which cloud provider will be used, AWS or GCP

Inside each cloud folder, there is a "modules" folder which contains reusable modules for usage throughout the project, as well as a "playbooks" folder that contains implemented playbooks for deploying certain applications. Administrators can either deploy the "playbook" directly, or copy an existing playbook and add additional modules and configurations to it.
